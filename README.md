# Classify candidate exoplanet based on Kepler observations
Evaluating different machine learning model to classify candidate exoplanet from NASA raw data-set

### Data Source
Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/kepler-exoplanet-search-results

### Background
Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system. Kepler has verified 3000 exoplants as of october 2017. The dataset is a cumulative record of all observed Kepler. The records includes approximately 10,000 exoplanet candidates Kepler has taken observations on. 
This dataset has an extensive data dictionary, which can be accessed here (https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/API_kepcandidate_columns.html).

### Goal
Evaluate different machine learning model to predict new exoplanets based on Kepler observation data
Identify a model with best prediction capacity
